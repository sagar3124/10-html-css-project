            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
            compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node. js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
            programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language
            Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API
            specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a
            feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some
            proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented
            in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some
            of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the
            stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially
            published.

              Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both
              "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of
              Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
              programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and
              use.

              JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to
              your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses
              when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic
              styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started
              with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is
              possible.

            JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience,
            you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
            comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more.Welcome to the MDN
            beginner's JavaScript course! In this first article we will look at
            JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "what is
            it?", and "what is it doing?", and making sure you are comfortable
            with JavaScript's purpose.Now you've learned something about the
            theory of JavaScript, and what you can do with it, we are going to
            give you a crash course on the basic features of JavaScript via a
            completely practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess
            the number" game, step by step.

            JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible.
            Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core
            JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with
            minimum effort. These include: Browser Application Programming
            Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality
            such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting
            and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating
            3D graphics and audio samples. Third-party APIs that allow
            developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content
            providers, such as Twitter or Facebook. Third-party frameworks and
            libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of
            building sites and applications.

            JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As
            your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new
            dimension of power and creativity. However, getting comfortable with
            JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML
            and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To
            begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating
            a Hello world! example.When you built up the "Guess the number" game
            in the previous article, you may have found that it didn't work.
            Never fear â€” this article aims to save you from tearing your hair
            out over such problems by providing you with some simple tips on how
            to find and fix errors in JavaScript programs.

        <h2>Hello world</h2>
        <article>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!

            Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within
            the scripts folder, create a new text document called main.js, and
            save it.This is doing the same job as the link element for CSS. It
            applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the
            HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).A semicolon
            at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only
            required when you need to separate statements on a single line.
            However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons
            at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you
            should and shouldn't use semicolons.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript
            works, let's explain some of the core features of the language. It's
            worth noting that these features are common to all programming
            languages.

            The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did
            this by using a function called querySelector() to grab a reference
            to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading.
            This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to
            do something to an element, you need to select it first. Following
            that, the code set the value of the myHeading variable's textContent
            property (which represents the content of the heading) to Hello
            world!.
